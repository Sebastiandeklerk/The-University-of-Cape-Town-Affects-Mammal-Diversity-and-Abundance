Habitat transformation and urbanization have large effects on biodiversity and habitat change. Some mammals may benefit from urbanization whilst others are disadvantaged (Concepion, 2015). 
Research from urban reserves worldwide reveal that small, generalist species are more likely to persist within and adjacent to urban areas (Fahrig, 2020). 
Additionally exotic species associated with human transformed land are more common in urban areas (Gaertner, 2017), while large predators are rare in urban and peri-urban spaces (McCabe, 2017). 
Urban areas may provide novel food sources, shelter and release from natural predators, but they also include new risks including pesticides, vehicles and domestic animals (Newsome, 2017).

In this study I compare mammal diversity in an urban landscape, the University of Cape Town (UCT) and compare this with the adjacent protected area of Table Mountain National Park (TMNP).

Several files have been uploaded: a R-script file with all code used for the analysis, data based on the camera trap footage, a map of the camera traps set up for this study and the final report.
